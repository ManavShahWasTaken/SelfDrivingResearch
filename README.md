Agent Files Contains the Jupyter Notebook which implements variations of the DQN Algorithm. 
You must currently set up the Unity Environment for this to work. 

-> First initialise the Unity Environment. 

-> Run the DQNAgent notebook. 

-> You may run the train agent function to see the training in action. Note that training takes around 12 hours for satisfatory results on a Macbook Pro with 2.6GHz Intel Core i7. 

-> You may otherwise run the evaluateAgent function with by passing a string directory to the weights file of the ConvNet as the parameter.
